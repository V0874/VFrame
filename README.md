A thin abstraction layer targeting the **ATmega2560**.

This project is primarily to experiment designing embedded systems with minimal dependencies.

The plan for the future is to build a layer on top once complete.

Furthermore, this project will be used to quickly prototype designs with the **ATmega2560**.
