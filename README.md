# VFrame

A framework that will be targeting the **ATmega2560**.

This project is primarily to gain a deeper understanding of embedded concepts.

Furthermore, this project will be used to quickly prototype designs for the **ATmega2560**.

Currently this project is on the back burner but I aim to resume once I get further along with # StringV.
